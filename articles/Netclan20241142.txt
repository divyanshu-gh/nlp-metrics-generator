To change the lipsing of the original video with the new replaced audio.
We needed to create an output video that will have the new lipsing according to the new replaced audio. Also we will have to change the actual audio with the new audio with automated editing.
We have created two different files which will perform 2 different operations 1st will replace the original audio with new and extract only video from original. 2nd will take the muted video and replaced audio and we will get the output of the new replaced audio lipsync. This is done by pre-defined model Wav2Lip on github.
